Why?
	
	As part of my highschool capstone course, I did research on game design and buisness tactics for a sucessful mobile game. When I was younger, I was always hooked to more simple arcade games compared to bigger open world games. As I started programming, one of my first goals was to make my own game and my capstone course was the perfect time to build my younger-self's dream game to supplement my research.


Game Controls: 

	Slide up and down on the left side of the screen to move the player and tap on the right side to shoot a fireball.
	
Project code is not public as it contains visual and audio assets I do not own the rights to distribute. I also plan on furthering this app in the near furture.
